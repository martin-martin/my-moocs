	<h1>Certificates I collected while learning Online</h1>
	<section class="intro">
		<p>
			On this page I will try to collect all the certificates I have gained since getting into MOOCs big time, which was towards the end of 2014. This aims at being a chronological collection, with the newest ones further up. On top, however, I'll put the <strong>Specializations</strong> I've finished, and also the ones I'm currently working on.

				<h2>Introduction to Programming Nanodegree</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/cert_ipnd.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/cert_ipnd.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					This ND includes a variety of independent MOOCs, for example: <em>Intro to HTML and CSS</em>, <em>Intro to Programming</em>, <em>Web Development</em>, <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> and <em>Intro to JavaScript</em>. I learned to use HTML, CSS, some JavaScript and practiced Python programming. Additionally, I practiced my theoretical understanding of internet and computer basics. This ND also set the foundation for me making this website :)
				</p>

				<h2>Data Analyst Nanodegree</h2>
				<a href="http://www.github.com/martin-martin" target="_blank"><img src="img/data_analyst.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					This ND summarizes a few MOOCs related to Data Science. I'm still working on it, so <a href='http://www.github.com/martin-martin'>here's a link</a> to my projects on github. So far I've encountered the SciPy stack (using iPython notebooks, numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and currently starting to work with cleaning and querying OSM data.

				<h1>2015</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Using Python to Access Web Data</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/accessingwebdata.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Took it as a light introduction to data acquistion that I'm learning more in-depth in the Data Analyst ND.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2><em class='verified'>Verified:</em> Process Mining: Data Science in Action</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/cert_procmin.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/cert_procmin.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Bringing data to life by mining the processes within. Creating process maps, working with <em>ProM</em> and <em>Disco</em>. I rediscovered Charles Joseph Minard's <a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png' target='_blank'><strong>map of Napoleon's defeat</strong></a> in Russia 1812-1813, which I find an inspiring example of Data Visualization. The course also talks about the similarities between processes and maps, and got me excited about cartography.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/python_6001x.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/python_6001x.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					A quite different Introduction to Python programming, that felt like a great additions to my knowledge up to then. It allowed me to approach the topic of programming more theoretically, and I'd say it encompasses quite some aspects of Computer Science.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Chicken Behaviour and Welfare</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/chickens.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/chickens.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					A beautiful course that taught me a lot of respect for chickens. Their peaks are extremely sensitve and greatly skilled perceptive organs!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Principles of Computing (Part 1)</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing1" target="_blank"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					It's a successor to <em>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</em>, however I did not enjoy this course as much. Too much aggressive 'joking' among the instructors. I stopped working on it after a while.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/maththink.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/maththink.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					It's one of my big tasks to train my math brain. This course was pleasant and interesting. I always liked logic, and I agree that one should take a walk/climb/bikeride as a break when brooding over some understanding.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Circadian Clocks: how rhythms structure life</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/circaclock.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/circaclock.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					The processes behind and effects of natural rhythms in our lifes (and how they are getting damaged daily). Every cell has its own clock, and we use <em>Zeitgeber</em> (especially light!) to synchronize. Records of births in Spain showed an annual oscillation until: the advent of electrical light.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Welcome to Game Theory</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/welcomegametheory.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/welcomegametheory.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					This course made my mind go 'whoa!' pretty often. Concepts of Game Theory jumped into all aspects of my life through watching the lectures. There's a stable balance that situations converge to - but: there are <em>more</em> stable situations. And only because one of them is, doesn't mean it's the best one! (I guess usually it isn't) But because every move away from there makes things (temporarily) worse, it's difficult to look for, and to find a better equilibrium.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Origins - Formation of the Universe, Solar System, Earth and Life</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/origins.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/origins.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Sounds like <em>Life, the Universe and Everything</em>. :) The course was really well made and I learned a lot about physics, geology, paleobiology and astronomy (especially those metorites stayed with me). Very thorough, interesting and insightful!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>An Introduction to Consumer Neuroscience & Neuromarketing</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/neuromarketing.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/neuromarketing.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					This course had a very interesting topic, and the lectures were pleasant. However, the written projects I got to peer review showed that understanding didn't come too easily to everyone.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Dino 101 : Dinosaur Paleobiology</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/dino101.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/dino101.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					I'm a Dino-kid. Knew the names, had the magazines and loads of hard-plastic figures. This course was a dive into my, and earth's, past. Learned a lot of new things, and re-learned some others. When I was small, dinosaurs didn't have feathers yet ;)

				<h1>2014</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Internet History, Technology, and Security</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/insidetheinternet.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/insidetheinternet.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					There's still much more to learn, but I got some insights into the inner functionings of the internet. Listened to inventors talk, thought about the layer model of TCP/IP, encryption techniques, and altogether managed to grasp some basics.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/epidemics.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Extremely interesting and well done! I did the whole course, passed all the quizzes and learned a lot (however, no certificate because I didn't do a forum post). I still felt like having the course among the others. Here I got to know about John Snow's <a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg' target='_blank'><strong>Cholera map</strong></a> of 1855. A great example of gaining insights from spatial mapping of information.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Programming for Everybody (Python)</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/pythonlearn.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/pythonlearn.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Yet another Intro to Python, a different and much lighter approach. The book is great (I read just a bit), and the course was a great way to relax a little while still staying on topic. Enjoyable!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Process Mining: Data Science in Action</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/procmin.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/procmin.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Taught me a lot about processes and was a lively way to learn about Data Science. I enjoyed this course so much, that I re-took it in 2015, even paying for a <em>Verified certificate</em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>How to Learn Maths: For Students</h2>
				<a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Education/EDUC115-S/Spring2014/info" target="_blank"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					Totally sweet! Made me start playing with numbers, and visualize operations with coloured squares. I'm still planning to finish this one, but keeping it around for motivational boosts :)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Introductory Human Physiology</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/physiology" target="_blank"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					Gained some insights into how it all works inside of myself. Good course, covering cell biology up to organ functions. Worked on it quite some, but didn't finish. While swimming lengths in the pool, I was thinking about the molecular processes that were going on inside of me!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2><em class='verified'>Verified:</em> An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/cert_interactivepython.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/cert_interactivepython.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					My first MOOC learning <strong>Python</strong>. I coded some little games. I especially enjoyed the very well done <em>Peer Review System</em> that allowed me to see a lot of other people's code and learn from giving feedback.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>From the Big Bang to Dark Energy</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/bigbang.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/bigbang.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					I have a weakness for Astronomy. I find it thoroughly exciting to understand for a short moment how tiny we are as compared to the distances and sizes that roam the universe. I'm just a tiny dot on a dot that is nothing but a tiny dot in another (slightly bigger) tiny dot revolving around a dot that is still pretty damn small and represents little areas in a growing space with many (but compared to the size only a few) small clusters of all these same dots I talked about before. :o
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Child Nutrition and Cooking</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/childnutrition" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/childnutrition.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Thinking about US cooking- and eating-habits, and learning a little about government tries to decrease obesity. Did it in night shifts.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Managing Your Time, Money, and Career: MBA Insights for Undergraduates</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/managingmoney.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/managingmoney.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Great tips and some handling of calculations. The course had a light and enjoyable pace, with lots of <em>take-aways</em> :) Got some insights into US culture, too. And yes: Compounding interest!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Economics 1: Principles of Economics</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/principles_of_economics.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="certificates/principles_of_economics.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Whoa! This was really good. The first MOOC I completed, working on it only for a few days, since I discovered it not long before the deadline. It was also my first real introduction to Economics ever, and so well delivered and gripping! I especially enjoyed the Orange-selling-game.
