	<h1>Certificates I collected while learning Online</h1>
	<section class="intro">
		<p>
			I took my first peek into MOOCs in the 2012 <em>AI Class</em>, however I did not finish it then. The <strong>concepts of studying online</strong> were appealing to me, but maybe the content was a little bit too difficult for me at that time. I did, however, spend a worthwile and interesting time while studying for the class in weekly meet-ups with friends of mine. And in doing so, I got myself exposed to some concepts of CS, maths and statistics, that I would encounter more in the coming years.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this page here I will try to collect all the certificates I have gained since getting into MOOCs big time, which was towards the end of 2014. This aims to be a chronological collection, with the newest ones further up. On top, however, I'll put the <strong>Specializations</strong> I've finished and also the ones I'm currently working on.

			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Introduction to Programming Nanodegree</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/cert_ipnd.pdf"><img src="certificates/cert_ipnd.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Learned to use HTML, CSS, some JavaScript and practiced Python programming. Among many other things, it set the foundation for me making this website :)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Data Analyst Nanodegree</h2>
				<a href="http://www.github.com/martin-martin"><img src="img/data_analyst.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Still working on it, here's a link to my projects on github. So far I've encountered the SciPy stack (using iPython notebooks, numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and currently starting to work with cleaning and querying OSM data.

			<div class="year">
				<h1>2015</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Using Python to Access Web Data</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data"><img src="certificates/accessingwebdata.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Took it as a light introduction to data acquistion that I'm learning more in-depth in the Data Analyst ND.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Process Mining: Data Science in Action</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/cert_procmin.pdf"><img src="certificates/cert_procmin.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Bringing data to life by mining the processes within. Creating process maps, working with ProM and Disco.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/python_6001x.pdf"><img src="certificates/python_6001x.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					A quite different Introduction to Python programming, that felt like a great additions to my knowledge until then. It allowed me to approach the topic of programming much more theoretically, and I'd say it encompasses quite some aspects of Computer Science.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Principles of Computing (Part 1)</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing1"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					It's a successor to IIPWP, however I did not enjoy the course so much. Stopped working on it at some point.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Chicken Behaviour and Welfare</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/chickens.pdf"><img src="certificates/chickens.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					A beautiful course that taught me a lot of respect for chickens. Their peaks are extremely sensitve and great perceptive organs! I'd recommend the course to anyone.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/maththink.pdf"><img src="certificates/maththink.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					It's one of my big tasks to train my math brain. This course was pleasant and interesting. I always liked logic, and I agree that one should take a walk/climb/bikeride as a break when brooding over some understanding.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Circadian Clocks: how rhythms structure life</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/circaclock.pdf"><img src="certificates/circaclock.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					The processes behind and effects of natural rhythms in our lifes (and how they are getting damaged daily). Every cell has its own clock, and we use <em>Zeitgeber</em> (especially light!) to synchronize. Records of births in Spain showed a annual oscillation until: the advent of electrical light.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Welcome to Game Theory</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/welcomegametheory.pdf"><img src="certificates/welcomegametheory.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					This course made my mind go 'whoa!' pretty often. Concepts of Game Theory jumped into all aspects of my life, while I watched. There's a stable balance that situations converge to - but there are more stable situations. And only because one is happening, doesn't mean it's the best! (I guess usually it isn't) But because every move from there makes things worse, it's difficult to look for and find better.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Origins - Formation of the Universe, Solar System, Earth and Life</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/origins.pdf"><img src="certificates/origins.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					<em>Life, the Universe and Everything</em>. The course was very well made and I learned a lot about physics, astronomy (especially those metorites stayed with me), geology and paleobiology. Very thorough and insightful!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Gamification</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamification"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					Sounded interesting in terms of concept, but the course wasn't very. Got still quite far, but didn't complete it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>An Introduction to Consumer Neuroscience & Neuromarketing</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/neuromarketing.pdf"><img src="certificates/neuromarketing.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					This course had a very interesting topic, and the lectures were pleasant. However, the written projects I got to peer review showed that understanding didn't come too easily to everyone.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Dino 101 : Dinosaur Paleobiology</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/dino101.pdf"><img src="certificates/dino101.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					I'm a Dino-kid. Knew the names, had the magazines and loads of hard-plastic figures. This course was a dive into my and earth's past. Learned a lot of new things, and re-learned some others. When I was small, dinosaurs didn't have feathers yet ;)

		<section class="year_2014">
			<div class="year">
				<h1>2014</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Internet History, Technology, and Security</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/insidetheinternet.pdf"><img src="certificates/insidetheinternet.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					There's still much more to learn, but I got some insights into the inner functioning of the internet. Listened to inventors talk, thought about the layer structure of TCP/IP and managed to grasp some basics.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics"><img src="certificates/epidemics.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Extremely interesting and well done! I did the whole course and learned a lot - however no certificate because I didn't post in the Forums :/ So here's my custom made one.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Programming for Everybody (Python)</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/pythonlearn.pdf"><img src="certificates/pythonlearn.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Yet another Intro to Python, a different and much lighter approach. The book is great (I read just a bit), and the course was a great way to relax a bit while still being on topic. Enjoyable!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Process Mining: Data Science in Action</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/procmin.pdf"><img src="certificates/procmin.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Taught me a lot about processes and was a lively way to learn about Data Science. I enjoyed this course so much, that I re-took it in 2015, even paying for a <em>Verified certificate</em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>How to Learn Maths: For Students</h2>
				<a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Education/EDUC115-S/Spring2014/info"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					Totally sweet! Made me start playing with numbers, and visualize operations with coloured squares. I'm still planning to finish this one, but keeping it around for motivational boosts :)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Your Body in the World: Adapting to Your Next Big Adventure</h2>
				<a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/EP101/Environmental_Physiology/info"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					A light and sweet course about Human Physiology. A guy tries getting cold, warm, high up, etc.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Introductory Human Physiology</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/physiology"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					Gained some insights into how it all works inside of myself. Good course, covering cell biology up to organ functions. Worked on it quite some, but didn't finish. While swimming lengths in the pool, I was thinking about the molecular processes happening to me!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/cert_interactivepython.pdf"><img src="certificates/cert_interactivepython.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					My first MOOC learning <strong>Python</strong>. I coded some little games. Especially enjoyed the very well done <em>Peer Review System</em> that allowed me to see a lot of other people's code and learn from giving feedback.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Personal &amp; Family Financial Planning</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/uffinancialplanning"><img src=""></a>
				<p>
					Worked through a quarter of the course. Got some practice and thinking about personal finances.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>From the Big Bang to Dark Energy</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/bigbang.pdf"><img src="certificates/bigbang.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					I have a weakness for Astronomy. I find it thoroughly exciting to understand for a short moment how tiny we are as compared to the distances and sizes that roam the universe. I'm just a tiny dot on a dot that is nothing but a tiny dot in another (slightly bigger) tiny dot revolving around a dot that is still pretty damn small and represents little areas in a growing space with many (but compared to the size only a few) small clusters of all these same dots I talked about before.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Child Nutrition and Cooking</h2>
				<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/childnutrition"><img src="certificates/childnutrition.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Thinking about US cooking- and eating-habits, and learning a little about government tries to decrease obesity. Did it in night shifts.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Managing Your Time, Money, and Career: MBA Insights for Undergraduates</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/managingmoney.pdf"><img src="certificates/managingmoney.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Great tips and some handling of calculations. Got some insights into US culture, too. And yes: Compounding interest!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Economics 1: Principles of Economics</h2>
				<a href="certificates_big/principles_of_economics.pdf"><img src="certificates/principles_of_economics.jpg"></a>
				<p>
					Whoa! This was really good. My first real introduction to Economics ever, and so well delivered and gripping! I especially enjoyed the Orange-selling-game.
