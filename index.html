	<h1>Certificates I collected while learning Online</h1>
	<section class="intro">
		<p>
			I took my first peek into MOOCs in the 2012 <em>AI Class</em>, however I did not finish it then. The <strong>concepts of studying online</strong> were appealing to me, but maybe the content was a little bit too difficult for me at that time. I did, however, spend a worthwile and interesting time while studying for the class in weekly meet-ups with friends of mine. And in doing so, I got myself exposed to some concepts of CS, maths and statistics, that I would encounter more in the coming years.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this page here I will try to collect all the certificates I have gained since getting into MOOCs big time, which was towards the end of 2014. This aims to be a chronological collection, with the newest ones further up. On top, however, I'll put the <strong>Specializations</strong> I've finished and also the ones I'm currently working on.

				<p>
					I learned to make Websites!

					Still working on it, here's a github link to my Projects so far.

				<h2>Using Python to Access Web Data</h2>
				<img src="img/img-7.png">
				<p>
					The continuation of this course that I started earlier in 2014. Sadly no more certificates while not on <em>Signature Track</em>. I again used it as a little side-activity for some light learning on-topic.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Process Mining: Data Science in Action</h2>
				<img src="img/img-3.png">
				<p>
					Done it twice. Good stuff! This time with <em>Verified Certificate</em>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Chicken Behaviour and Welfare</h2>
				<img src="img/img-5.png">
				<p>
					A very interesting and gentle course, that taught me lots about chickens! It instilled some more respect in me towards their sensitive peaks, grooming actions and social behaviour. A beautifully sad lullaby.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>600.1x Python Programming</h2>
				<img src="img/img-2.png">
				<p>
					A very interesting course that I started more often, and finally completed in one iteration in 2015. It offered a new aspect of Python programming to me, introducing concepts like big-O complexity, try-except clauses and some theoretical background knowledge that nicely complemented other beginner's courses I had taken.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Chronobiology</h2>
				<img src="img/img-7.png">
				<p>
					How do rhythms affect our lives. Every cell has a tiny watch inside, and we use external cues (especially light) to synchronize them all together. We evolved with clear and reliable <em>Zeitgeber</em>, using the light/dark hours, the seasonal temperature changes, the moon phases and some other animals also the tides, to orientate and synchronize a collection of hopelessly individual cells that need to work together to keep such a complex system going. Modern use of artificial lighting and central heating brings lots of confusion within.

				<h2>Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases</h2>
				<img src="img/img-2.png">
				<p>
					I did all the exams and scored a reasonably high % too - however it was compulsory to also do two posts on the forums, and at that time I wasn't yet into posting on forums. Got altogether 76% of 80% required. Didn't know this was required to receive a certificate, so I ended up not getting any... The course was quite interesting, though, and I enjoyed taking it. Gave me an interesting introduction to this section of biology, and it was the place I first heard of Snow's mapping of the Cholera outbreak, which is a beautiful example of using cartography for understanding. Pennsilvania State University.

				<h2>Python for Everyone</h2>
				<img src="img/img-2.png">
				<p>
					I did this one alongside <em>Interactive Programming with Python</em>, and it was a nice addition. The concepts that were explained were altogether much easier and lighter, which gave me a chance to take a break while still staying on topic.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Interactive Programming with Python</h2>
				<img src="img/img-1.png">
				<p>
					This was my first MOOC where I got some hands-on experience with programming in Python. I enjoyed especially the very well done <em>Peer Review</em> system, where I think I learned a lot through looking and grading other people's code.
				</p>

			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>From the Big Bang to Dark Energy</h2>
				<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1QbtI4ACfDxajB6VUFHamd1bzg">
				<p>
					I have a weakness for Astronomy. I find it thoroughly exciting to understand for a short moment how tiny we are as compared to the distances and sizes that roam the universe. I'm just a tiny dot on a dot that is nothing but a tiny dot in another (slightly bigger) tiny dot revolving around a dot that is still pretty damn small and represents little areas in a growing space with many (but compared to the size only a few) small clusters of all these same dots I talked about before.

			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Managing Your Time, Money and Everything - MBA Insights</h2>
				<img src="img/img-5.png">
				<p>
					Sweet course taught by a fellow student. I got to know about many concepts that are generally applicable, and some that more relate to the US (e.g. about credit points). I enjoyed this course quite a lot.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Child Nourishment and Cooking</h2>
				<img src="img/img-5.png">
				<p>
					Maybe this was it actually. I did it in a fast-run within a few nights at home. Thinking about US cooking and eating habits, and learning a little about government tries to decrease obesity.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mooc">
				<h2>Economics</h2>
				<img src="img/img-7.png">
				<p>
					This was my first MOOC that I completed. I did it in a fast-run, because the deadline was already approaching when I got started on it. It was extremely interesting for me, giving me the first academic introduction to economics that I got so far. I especially enjoyed the Orange-selling game.
